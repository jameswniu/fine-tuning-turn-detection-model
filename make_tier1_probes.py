"""Rebuild the twelve tier-1 guardrail rows from the committed data.

These are the constraints `pick_threshold.py --constraints` enforces: the absolutes of POLICY.md,
which no operating point is allowed to violate on the served artifact. The file they live in was
written to /tmp during the v7 to v9 work and the machine cleaned it up, so the twelve rows existed
nowhere by 2026-08-29. They were never arbitrary, though. Every one is a row of a committed file,
selected by a rule, so the set is derived here rather than remembered:

  every F-class card in the gold set          announced continuation, must hold        4
  gold card H5                                the hold-that-thought case               1
  dev card dH4                                the card int8 quantization moved         1
  every regression row, with its own label    each one traced to a live miss           6

Run `make tier1` to regenerate. The output is committed so a reviewer can rerun the constrained
pick without owning this machine.
